        <h1 class="mb-3">Marcus Brown
        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AnalyticsðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I graduated from Carter High School getting my high school diploma. I like to work out to stay healthy. This includes going on runs, going to the gym, and practicing. I joined a muay thai club on campus. This has helped me develop a lot of discipline and self-control that I have translated into my school life and personal life. I also plan on doing competitions when I have spare time to train harder just for fun. One thing is that by valuing your health and making sure you feel happy about it. I believe can lead to longevity in whatever career you choose if it involves physical labor or not. Making sure that you are physically healthy by whatever standards you want or goals you have can help you last longer physically in your career. So this is why this is something I choose to make sure I make time for in my life. It also can help us have a healthier mind which can even help provide more longevity in our career. This is something a lot of people forget which is why I make sure not to forget.
<br><br>

        Iâ€™m also a very punctual person this is because I believe that one of the most important traits to have is valuing being on time. I feel that by being on time you are setting yourself up for success. This is because by being late you setting yourself up to miss things and show poor time management, and in general this can say a lot about a personâ€™s character. So if it is to a meeting, work, practice, or even a work outing I make sure that I show up early or I am on time for whatever it is. In general, it is always better for someone to be early or on time rather than be late. I rather pick the options that donâ€™t have any downsides to them rather than the option that can have a list of downsides.
<br><br>

        Lastly, I love to value family, knowledge, and my career/hobbies; these three things I believe are the three successes of life. Having success in these 3 categories leads to overall happiness in life and more. I feel that my striving to achieve success in these 3 categories leads to qualities that businesses look for in people. For example, when people value family a lot and want success in it they tend to be trustworthy, loyal, honest, and more. So when businesses look at people to hire they want people that have these qualities or these traits. Knowledge doesnâ€™t always mean you are educationally smart but means you are wise. Some managers want people with wisdom. Hobbies and careers People who value that tend to strive to be the best at what they do or whatever they put their mind to. So thatâ€™s why I hold these 3 things so highly since in general they are good to have. Also, they lead to a better life style and translate well when it comes to work.
